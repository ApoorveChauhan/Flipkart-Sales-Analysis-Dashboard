## 5) Project Highlights
### Business Problem
E-commerce companies like Flipkart generate massive sales data daily. However, raw data does not provide direct answers to business-critical questions such as:
1) Which age group and gender contributes the most sales?
2) Which categories and sub categories generates the highest revenue and sales?
3) What is the impact of returns and delayed deliveries on performance?
4) Which delivery type are most preferred by customers?
5) Which regions/cities are the strongest contributors to sales?
### Goal of the Dashboard
To deliver an interactive analytical tool that:
1) Tracks sales and revenue trends across categories and time.
2) Provides insights into customer demographics and behavior.
3) Highlights return and delivery issues for operational improvements.
4) Supports strategic decisions such as inventory planning, targeted marketing and regional focus.

### Insights Generated 
1) Customers in the 30–40 age group contribute the most sales (mainly in Health & Beauty), while the 80+ group contributes the least.
👉 Focus marketing campaigns and product promotions on the 30–40 age group to boost sales, while exploring ways to engage older customers with tailored products.
3) Health & Beauty has the highest number of returns, mostly due to missing items.
👉 Improve quality checks and packaging in this category to reduce return rates and increase customer satisfaction.
4) Sales peaked in May 2020 and were lowest in February 2019.
👉 Plan seasonal promotions during high-demand months and create strategies to drive sales in traditionally low-performing months.
5) Greater Accra generated the highest revenue, while Oyarifa recorded the lowest.
👉 Invest more in logistics and promotions in Oyarifa and other low-performing regions to improve sales coverage.
6) Best-selling product: Avon Soft Musk Eau de Toilette Spray – 50ml. Least-selling product: Canon EOS 60D DSLR Bundle.
👉 Keep sufficient stock of high-demand products like Avon and reduce or replace underperforming products such as the Canon DSLR.
7) Health & Beauty is the highest-selling category, while Electronics has the lowest sales.
👉 Continue strengthening Health & Beauty promotions while analyzing reasons for weak sales in Electronics to reposition or market better.
8) Standard Delivery generated the maximum sales.
👉 Maintain reliable Standard Delivery services and consider incentivizing premium delivery options to increase adoption.
9) 82% of customers are repeat buyers, 18% are new customers.
👉 High retention is good, but marketing strategies should focus on acquiring more new customers to expand the customer base.
10) Male customers generated 52% of sales, females 48%.
👉 Both genders are almost equally contributing, so balanced marketing targeting both male and female customers is essential.
11) 27% of total orders were returned.
👉 A high return rate indicates potential issues in product quality, descriptions, or logistics—improving these can directly reduce losses.
12) Most orders were shipped from abroad.
👉 Explore opportunities to stock more items locally to reduce delivery time and increase customer satisfaction.
13) Health & Beauty shows the maximum product returns.
👉 Reinforce stricter supplier checks, ensure proper packaging, and improve product accuracy in listings to minimize repeat issues in this category.
