## 5) Project Highlights
### Business Problem
E-commerce companies like Flipkart generate massive sales data daily. However, raw data does not provide direct answers to business-critical questions such as:

2) Which categories and sub categories generates the highest revenue and sales?
3) What is the impact of returns and delayed deliveries on performance?
4) Which delivery type are most preferred by customers?
5) Which regions/cities are the strongest contributors to sales?
### Goal of the Dashboard
To deliver an interactive analytical tool that:
1) Tracks sales and revenue trends across categories and time.
2) Provides insights into customer demographics and behavior.
3) Highlights return and delivery issues for operational improvements.
4) Supports strategic decisions such as inventory planning, targeted marketing and regional focus.
