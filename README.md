## Project Highlights 
### Business Problem
E-commerce companies like Flipkart generate massive sales data daily. However, raw data does not provide direct answers to business-critical questions such as:
•	Which age group and gender contributes the most sales?
•	Which categories and sub categories generates the highest revenue?
•	What is the impact of returns and delayed deliveries on performance?
•	Which delivery type are most preferred by customers?
•	Which regions/cities are the strongest contributors to sales?
### Goal of the Dashboard
To deliver an interactive analytical tool that:
•	Tracks sales and revenue trends across categories and time.
•	Provides insights into customer demographics and behavior.
•	Highlights return and delivery issues for operational improvements.
•	Supports strategic decisions such as inventory planning, targeted marketing, and regional focus.
